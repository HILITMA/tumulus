Tumulus

This project is about collecting and displaying our memory for when we will be
off to a better place.

Currently just a prototype, tumulus is center on developing a memorial for the
Internet's own boy, [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aharonsw.com).  For now, the only
real info in the system is Aaron's name, dates and religion there are thousands
of bits of information Aaron published on many mediums and we plan to collect
them all and help the viewer get to know a fregment of Aaron.

Contribuitions are welcomed - we use jQuery for the frontend and Python for
writing collection & scraping scripts when needed.
